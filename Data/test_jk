Most VC’s typically “pass” on a deal with a line like “you’re too early for us, but let’s stay in touch as you execute your plan and hit your milestones.”  Why wouldn’t they?  This non-pass pass gives the VC a second opportunity to see a deal – and let’s the VC avoid the finality of declaring: “Nope, we’re not ever going to fund you.”  In a business that’s all about maintaining options, the non-pass pass has become standard practice.  At First Round Capital, we can’t follow this standard practice.  We prefer to see (and fund) companies early – after all, we’re not Second Round Capital.  We are comfortable with “Powerpoint Risk” (ie, funding powerpoints) and are used to funding incomplete technologies, teams and business models.  Our fund’s average initial investment is just under $500,000.  So I found it ironic last week, when, I ended up passing on several startups using a line like “you’re too late for us – I wish I had seen you six months ago during your angel round.”  Since our inception, First Round Capital has always been focused on early-stage, seed investments.    Just last week we closed a new fund.   And as rumors spread that we might be raising a larger fund, we’ve already started to get more inbound requests for larger, later-stage, deals – ($2+ million funding rounds).   But while our fund is larger, our focus remains the same.  We plan to continue to make the same early-stage, seed investments we always have.   The same initial investment size.  The same investment style.  And the same investment strategy.  Our average initial investment will remain around $500,000.   And our investment goal remains the same – to help an entrepreneur validate, “de-risk,” or disprove his/her hypothesis…and to do so as quickly and capital efficiently as possible.   The only real difference is that we won’t be raising a new venture fund annually (as we did in the past), allowing us to spend more time with our portfolio companies and looking at new deals.    So in an election year where everyone seems to scrambling to embrace "CHANGE", we’re looking forward to more of the same in 2008 and beyond.  (And keep the Powerpoints coming – you can’t send them early enough!) 
 I recently returned from a family vacation, and while I tried not to do much "work", I did find that a hotel can provide an interesting ecosystem to observe some interesting pricing dynamics.      Pick a Price, Any Price Despite my best efforts to kick the habit, I still find myself addicted to Diet Coke.  And while I was able to lower my intake on vacation, I still found myself craving a Diet Coke or two during the day.   What surprised me was the multitude of different places -- and different prices -- a single hotel sold the same product for.  The mini-bar in the room sold a can of diet coke for $3.50 (ouch!).  The soda machine down the hall sold it for $1.00.  The gift shop sold it for $2.00.  You can order it in one of their restaurants for $2.50 a glass (with free refills) or you can get it delivered poolside for $2.50 (with no refills).   And you can order it via room-service for $2.50 plus a $2 delivery fee.  Five different prices (ranging from $1 to $4.50) for the same product.  The only difference is the method of delivery -- and the convenience each method offers the consumer.    And this got me thinking- can this model work online?  Are there examples of online services which charge differentially for the exact same product?  Let me know what you think...   The Anti-Penny Gap I've written before on "The Penny Gap" -- where I discussed the challenge in converting a user from free to paying.   In that post I concluded that the hardest part of an online business was "getting your users to pay you anything at all".  Well, after this vacation I have to add an amendment to my theory.    My wife and I wanted to go out to dinner without the kids a few times on the trip, so we asked the concierge if they could recommend any baby sitters.  The provided me with a list of three services - Capable Caregivers, Affordable Assistance, and Reliable Babysitting Agency.  There was no description of the services.  No references.  No recommendations.  No listing of "years in business".  Just their names, prices and contact information.    So how am I to choose which one to select?  Do I trust my kids lives with "Affordable Assistance" for $12.50 an hour?  Or do I select the more expensive "Capable Caregivers?"  Well, in the absence of any comparative information, I chose the Capable Caregivers.  (As did, it appears, everyone else in the hotel -- my informal study of six other families who hired babysitters from the hotel concluded that everyone chose the most expensive option).  So I hereby amend the Penny Gap theory -- when a decision involves (1) safety/security/risk, (2) children, and/or (3) information assymetry, the highest price is often chosen over all over options.  Let me know any other places where the "Anti-Penny Gap" applies. 
 No I haven't abandoned blogging.  I've just been a little swamped lately.  So, one of my New Year's resolutions is to blog more.  (Hopefully I'm able to fulfill that resolution more than my prior resolutions to exercise more or eat better).  Anyhow, I just want to shoot a quick congratulations to a few of our portfolio companies.  First, to Mint.com, for being selected as one of the 25 Most Innovative Products of the Year by PC World.  And second, to RockYou for being selected by Fortune Magazine as one of the "Six Leaps of Innovation" to "keep an eye on in 2008".  (Although, the list clearly can't be very selective if they also selected this).  Finally, I was amazed to see that our companies have been nominated for a total of nine "Crunchie Awards" -- and if you haven't already voted, I encourage you to vote for Like, Pleo, Weatherbill, Attributor, 1-800-FREE-411, OpenAds, RockYou, Mint.com, and Lance Tokuda.  I wish you all a happy, healthy and prosperous New Year.  (And stay tuned for some new blog posts in early January, as I usually keep my resolutions for at least a few weeks)... 
 We live our lives by routines.  In January, we all make resolutions for the new year.  In November, we give thanks for the bounty of the harvest at Thanksgiving.  And for those in the tech industry, in October we go to the Web 2.0 Conference and try to outdo each other with our declarations of "Bubble 2.0".  Today's NY Times story declares that "Silicon Valley’s math is getting fuzzy again."  This sounds somewhat similar to their story last year which concluded that: "Web 2.0...has in recent months become the focus of dot-com-style hype in Silicon Valley..."  As people leave the conference this evening to write their obligatory "we're in a bubble" story, I thought it would be helpful to provide them with examples from the last few years, so they can find new ways to express the same thoughts...    2004  "To be sure, conference organizers seemed aware of the possibility of a looming hype machine. One panel early Wednesday featured stock analysts mulling the thesis: Is it a bubble yet?" - CNet News.com  "The web is entering another bubble of optimism..." - Read/Write Web  "No greater shroud hangs over Web 2.0 then the fear that we'll repeat the financial mistakes of the past..." - IT Conversations  "The Web 2.0 conference was an online lovefest, where an array of speakers repeated that the Internet is still in its infancy. A panel of financial analysts and venture capitalists questioned whether the industry is going through another bubble.." - SF Chronicle     2005  “The industry is still tingling from the loud and sweaty Bubble 2.0 — whoops, excuse me, Web 2.0 — conference here late last week.” - USA Today  “No Web 2.0 Bubble? Hmmm.... even the backers of the recent Web 2.0 conference warned that things were getting frothy” - Business Week  "I heard many people say it felt very bubblelike. in fact, every party or event seemed like a lead in to this topic." - Mark Pincus  “What was a budding movement three years ago, at the dawn of the revival in technology, internet, and silicon valley, has become a full blown mania.” - Fred Wilson  "At the Web 2.0 conference, I'm sensing the buzz of a bubble" - Read/Write Web     2006  "Are we in a bubble? Absolutely" - Read/Write Web  "Web 2.0 was the same dance all over again: this tech bubble, boomy, exuberant thing that happens when money hangs like a bumper crop in an orchard.  At the conference, I swear there was a ka-ching sound in every techie's step." - USA Today  "For industry players, many of whom lived through the dot-com crash, the surging wave of new Web companies and the corresponding media buzz can mean only one thing: an investment bubble where too much money is chasing too few good ideas." - CNet News.com  "(Did someone say bubble? Not at this conference, please!)" - SFgate.com  "It isn’t dot-com bubble level, I’m told, but darn close." - Forbes     Even a broken clock is right two times a day.  By proclaiming a bubble every year, everyone can say they "called it."     
 I’ve recently come to the conclusion that Web 2.0 no longer has any unique meaning.  It now means “any Internet-based company that has launched after 2004”. It is as useless a descriptor as “dot com” was.  Jason Calacanis today posted his attempt to define Web 3.0. Like Fred, I sure hope we can find a better name for it than 3.0. I also think that Jason’s proposed definition is incomplete. I believe that a big part of “what comes next” will center around the Implicit Web.  Since the Wikipedia entry on Implicit Web is pretty obtuse/complex, here’s what I mean by implicit web:  As people spend more time online and perform more of their activities online, they create a lot of data about themselves online. Netflix knows what movies I watch and like. Apple knows what music I purchase and listen to. Amazon knows what books I purchase and like. Evite knows what events/parties I’m going to. Tivo knows what TV shows I like. Opentable knows where I like to eat. Fandango knows what movies I go to. Ticketmaster knows what shows I’ve seen.   However, until now that data has existed in silos. There has been no easy way for me (as a user) to access and benefit from that data.  I think the Implicit Web will give users the ability to control the data in these silos and decide who and how it gets shared with.   Let’s take a simple example. If a user joins Facebook today and wants to complete their personal profile, they get presented with several blank boxes (see right) to fill out. However, via the Implicit Web, as user should be able to tell Facebook to:  check Apple (or Rhapsody or iLike) for their Favorite Music check Tivo (or Comcast) for their favorite TV shows check Netflix (or Flixster) for their favorite Movies, and to check Half.com (or Amazon) for their favorite Books.  Why should users be forced to re-create data that already exists? Talk about a waste of time.  I think there is a huge opportunity here. In fact, it reminds me of an opportunity I saw in 2000. In 2000, Sony launched their Playstation 2 – and they were quickly sold out. Over 50,000 Playstation 2’s were listed on eBay in the first week. That means that 50,000 sellers had to go to eBay and spend 15+ minutes creating the exact same listing. Every seller had to type-in the same description and upload the same picture. That’s over 12,500 hours wasted re-creating something that already existed elsewhere.  And that helped shape the vision of Half.com.  First Round Capital is actively looking to invest in companies that help make the Implicit Web a reality – either by breaking down the silos or by taking advantage of the data in a new way.  One final story. I remember hearing a story about a research study on dating (I haven’t been able to find the exact study – if anyone knows it, please tell me). Researchers basically arranged two types of blind dates. The first group of blind dates was a traditional dinner – where two people spent two hours talking and getting to know each other. The second group of blind dates was a little different. For this group, they took one person and let them spend five minutes alone in the other person's home or apartment. They could see their fridge, their clothes, their books, their music, how messy/neat the house was, etc.  And they found that the person who spent five minutes collecting implicit data got a far better (and more accurate) picture of their date then the person who spent two hours collecting explicit data by conversing.  I wonder if the same results will hold online… 
 So, I know I've been a bit quiet on the blogging front lately.  A combination of a crazy schedule, overflooded inbox and an injury have taken their toll.  I have been making my "list of things to blog about when I have time" -- and I hope to have some time next week, so stay tuned.  In the meanwhile, a few small updates on the last month:    Portfolio company, Mashery, closed their next round of funding from Formative Ventures and Accelerator Group.  Mashery is also currently sponsoring Dealmaker Media's one-day conference, "The Business of APIs".  If your company is doing anything new on the web today, you are probably looking at APIs and Web Services -- and this conference seems like a unique opportunity to learn from several companies who have already launched API distribution programs.  Brett Hurt and the Bazaarvoice team also recently announced their most recent round of funding, led by Battery Ventures.  Watching these guys execute has been amazing -- their client list reads like a "who's who" of ecommerce.  We also recently led a seed-stage investment in Satisfaction Unlimited.  Satisfaction provides a set of tools that allow companies to crowdsource their support amongst their customers.  They are part online discussion, part FAQ, and part social network. Anyone can ask a question, submit an idea or problem, or just talk.   Love a company?  Hate a company?  Get some Satisfaction here...  One of our (west-coast) portfolio companies, is actively (urgently) seeking an IT/Operations person (either full-time or contractor).  They are looking for someone with expertise in (1) running a 99.99% uptime high traffic consumer site, (2) colocation management and bandwidth provisioning, and (3) Linux, Apache, Tomcat, Java and MySQL.  If you know of anyone, please let me know...  I broke my shoulder a few weeks ago.  In order to spare myself the "Groundhog's Day" experience of repeating the same conversation 20+ times a day, I decided to put the footage of the injury on Youtube... 
 Congratulations to Aaron Patzer and the entire Mint.com team for their selection as the "best presenting company" at the Techcrunch40 conference.  Given the 40 amazing companies that presented there, this honor is quite an endorsement.  It's been just about one year since we made our initial investment in Mint, and this is quite a way to launch a product!  (If you're interested in a free web-based tool that helps you manage and make money, check out mint.com today)...  I'm also excited that two additional First Round Capital portfolio companies launched at Techcrunch40 to great reviews -- Xobni and Powerset.  Xobni is well on their way towards making Outlook suck less -- check it out here.  And Powerset is working hard towards improving your ability to search the web intelligently.  I can't tell you how bummed I was that I was unable to make the conference due to a prior commitment - but First Round Capital was well represented by Chris and Rob.  I continue to be amazed at the power and scale of the Techcrunch platform that Michael Arrington is building.  Congratulations to Michael, Jason and Heather as well on what sounds like an amazing maiden conference! 
 Congratulations to Ari and Todd on their sale to Marchex (NASDAQ: MCHX).   I first met the Voicestar guys back in 2005.  They were among the pioneers of the pay-per-call market -- and I recall being amazed by how much they accomplished with no outside money.  They funded their first year of operations by consulting in their "spare time".  Todd was a coding animal --  writing every line of code in the product by himself.  And Ari was an unbelievably persistent (and persuasive) business development machine -- singlehandedly managing a pipeline of over 100 prospects.   And in March of 2006 Voicestar raised their first round of outside capital (with First Round Capital ultimately becoming their largest outside investor).  Voicestar has continued to be a model of capital efficiency --  only raising about $1 Million since inception.  And they executed perfectly -- growing nearly 20% month-over-month and signing up over 200 publisher partners (including some major metro newspapers, the yellow pages giant R.H. Donnelley (RHD), and Val-Pak (CEI), the coupon publisher).  As a result of their capital efficiency and limited dilution, the founders were in a position to take advantage of what I previously have called "The New Dual Track."  The fact that a company can exit for $20 million and still be a "win" for both founders and investors is definitely illustrative of some major changes in the startup/venture ecosystem.    I wish the entire team the best of luck at Marchex -- and hope our paths cross again soon.  Ari and Todd are a class act - two hard-core entrepreneurs who built a real business the hard way.  A bottle of Dom is on the way...  
 Jeremy Liew of Lightspeed Ventures recently blogged about Asymmetric risk and the dangers of too high a valuation.   This is something I've been thinking about for the last several months, as I observed several new trends:    Valuations have increased pretty significantly over the last year.   Like Jeremy, I have witnessed an increase in valuations over the last year, with most of the increase occurring in Series B or Series C rounds.  This was validated by the most recent Fenwick & West Venture Capital Barometer which showed a 75% average price increase for companies receiving venture capital in 1Q07 compared to such companies’ previous financing round. This was the largest increase since the survey began.  The number of exits has decreased over the last year. At the same time that valuations have increased, the number of total exits have decreased.  According to the most recent NVCA Exit Poll, there has been an 18% drop in the number of venture-backed exits for the first half of 2007 when compared to the first half of 2006.  Specifically, there were 188 exits in 1H 2007 (144 M&A exits and 44 IPOs) versus 228 exits in 1H 2006 (199 M&A exits and 29 IPOs).  An increasing portion of M&A exits are occuring below $150 Million. According to the Jeffries Broadview Global M&A database, 72% of Venture-Backed M&A for the past 4 years has been below $150 Million.  Take a look at the chart below.  What do these three trends mean?  I believe that under certain circumstances, they argue that that high valuations in a Series B/C round are not always the best thing for entrepreneurs.   Now before you go off saying that as a VC I have a reason to advocate for lower valuations, wait a second.  My firm, First Round Capital, is a seed-stage investor.  As the first money in, our interests tend to be aligned with entrepreneurs -- if the company gets a high valuation for a Series B or C round, both the entrepreneur and my firm experience less dilution.  And if the company takes a lower valuation, we both get diluted.  So we have a pretty good reason to try to maximize valuation.  However, in many cases I think that might be shortsighted.  When a company gets a term sheet with a high valuation, they need to pay attention to the unwritten term on the term sheet.  Specifically, they should make sure they are comfortable with the exit multiple that would generate the returns needed to satisfy their VC.  While every situation is unique, here's a simple rule of thumb:  Series A – 10x Series B – 4-7X Series C – 2-4X  So, once you sign a Series B the term sheet valuing your company at a $50M premoney, you’ve basically signed up for at least a $200M exit target.  With the data showing that there are fewer exits -- and those that do exit happen at lower prices -- I think it's worth considering whether you want to eliminate the head-end of the M&A curve (ie, with 72% of all exits occuring below $150M, why force yourself into the “moonshot” trajectory?).     Now, I’m all for playing to win – and going for the billion dollar outcome.  However, I think there is a concrete financial value to keeping your options open.  As an investor in StumbleUpon and del.icio.us, I can pretty confidently say that had either company elected to raise a Series B round -- it would have been very difficult (if not impossible) for the founders to choose to sell their companies when they did.  And while Jason Calacanis believes that "there is little risk to raising too much money", I respectfully disagree.  Had Jason raised a large venture round at Weblogs, Inc. I doubt he would have been in a position to accept AOL's acquisition offer.  One thing to note, I'm not saying that there aren't times where a company's progress/opportunity is so compelling, that it makes sense to decide to take the asymmetric risk and lock yourself into a big-exit trajectory.  We've definitely participated in several of those deals.  But I am saying that, in my experience, most entrepreneurs aren't making a conscious decision to go for the moonshot.  By optimizing solely for valuation/dilution, they aren't considering the outcomes they are removing from the table, or the added risk they are taking given the changing exit landscape.  As Brad Feld concluded when he commented on Jeremy's post, they key is to "pay attention to the risks of having valuations being both too high and too low, and understand the asymmetries in those risks."  One final note -- I continue to believe what I have said over and over --that "entrepreneurs should focus on building real, long-term value" and "you can't build a company to sell it."  I am not advocating that you build a company with the primary focus to sell it.  What I am saying, is that too many founders are not aware that they are shutting off the majority of exits -- and therefore increasing risks -- when they accept a high valuation.  When people say there is "no risk" to raising a lot of money or getting a high valuation, I think they are not looking at the current exit realities 
 I spent all day yesterday on the phone. 12+ hours of phone conversations – and I went to bed last night with a sore throat. So when I woke up this morning with no voice, I wasn’t completely surprised.  I had two entrepreneur pitches and one board meeting in New York City today – and I felt OK – so I decided to take the meetings. Initially, I was extremely concerned that my laryngitis would dramatically reduce my effectiveness and productivity in the meetings. However, as the day went on, I noticed something interesting. Because it was so difficult for me to talk, it forced me to make every word count. Where I previously might have interjected with a question, now I was writing them down to see if they got answered elsewhere in the presentation. If I wanted to provide feedback or an opinion, I was much more concise than I otherwise would have been. And, I found that my meetings were just as productive/effective as they would have been if I could speak freely.  So what should I learn from this? Well, I guess it shows that I should talk less and listen more (something my wife has been saying for years). And when I do choose to speak, I should conserve my words. It will be interesting to see if I have the discipline to continue this when my voice returns…\ 
 Some portfolio company news today.  First, today we announced our investment in OpenAds, the developer of the leading free, open source adserving platform.  Already used by more than 20,000 publishers across 140 countries in 20 languages, Openads powers more publishers than all competing solutions combined.  What really excites me about OpenAds is that they are in a wonderful position to shrink the adserving market.  By removing the adserving costs, publishers can now focus on raising their effective CPM.  This is especially important for small and mid-sized publishers, who previously had a limited choice of adserving technologies – and no real ability to impact pricing.  I look forward to working with Scott and his team, along with our co-investors (Index Ventures, Mangrove Capital Partners and O'Reilly AlphaTech Ventures) on this deal…  Second, as Techcrunch has reported, Cuts.com has been acquired by Rifftrax.  Although Cuts.com’s product has been praised for its ease of use and fun, the market for a stand-alone video editing site has quickly become very crowded and competitive.   And while this transaction was not the huge win we were playing for, I’m happy that Evan and his team were able to find a home for their business.  As I wrote back in March, the goal of a seed-stage investment is to validate (or disprove) a venture's hypothesis – and successful entrepreneurs will do so using as little time and capital as possible.  Evan Krauss and his Cuts.com team did just that.  
 As First Round Capital's portfolio has grown over the last few years, our firm's website has not grown with it.  That's why we recently decided that an overhaul of our website was necessary. So, in addition to the traditional alphabetical listing of portfolio companies, we decided to try something new. To help people better navigate our portfolio, we recently launched a tag cloud. This provides an interesting perspective on where we’ve concentrated our investments. We also improved the portfolio company detail pages – providing both company news and job openings…    In addition, we also just launched an experiment. For the last several weeks, I have been an active member of Ycombinator’s Startup News site. Like Digg, their site allows any member of their community to submit news items – with the best rising to the top. At First Round Capital, my partners and I have historically shared news stories using a common del.icio.us tag. Inspired by Ycombinator’s site, we’ve decided to experiment with allowing members of our community to submit stories on our site as well. I invite you to visit http://news.firstround.com to submit, share, and vote on stories and websites.  We look forward to seeing the stories you find interesting.   Finally, I just wanted to thank my partner, Rob Hayes, and our west-coast office manager, Carly Spoljaric, for organizing a wonderful cocktail party last week. Pictures of the party available here. 
 I'm at the WSJ D Conference this week, and just saw Jason Calacanis launch Mahalo.com.   Mahalo is intended to be a "human powered" search engine.  Apparently, the top 20,000 queries to Google represent almost a third of all their traffic -- and with the rise in SEO and search-engine spam, many of the top results are of little value to their users.  Mahalo believes that humans can help make search results better and has hired 40 human editors to hand-craft the results pages for the top queries.  They've done 4,000 pages to date and hope to have 10,000 pages by year-end.  A big, bold bet.  It also sounds similar to the old McKinely Magellan Internet Guide of 1995 (see Internet Archive's copy of the site here).   From an old Magellan press release:  Magellan is the product of a marriage between McKinley's proprietary search technology and its unique editorial process. Sites in the Magellan guide are reviewed and rated by a highly informed editorial staff, with expertise in topical areas. The resulting site evaluations not only provide users with in-depth information, but also a human voice. 
 Congrats to Garrett, Justin, Geoff, David and the rest of the StumbleUpon team on their sale to eBay.  (A bottle of Dom is on it's way).  I've thoroughly enjoyed my association and involvement with the company - and look forward to seeing how eBay harnesses the power of StumbleUpon's discovery engine.  They guys blog about the sale here, Michael Arrington and Om Malik share their thoughts here and here.  I'd like to thank fellow StumbleUpon board member Ariel Poler, Brad O'Neill, and Ted Wang for their hands-on involvement - the company could not have had better advisors... Our analyst, Mazen Araabi, has just started a new blog.  He's off to a good start with his post on The Most Common Mistake Entrepreneurs Make. Congratulations to my friend Jeff Jordan on his new role at OpenTable.  This is a big win for OpenTable.  In addition to being a great guy, Jeff is one of the smartest, execution-focused executives I know.  I reported to Jeff for two years after eBay purchased Half.com -- and I learned an unbelievable amount from him.  While I was a big fan (and user) of OpenTable before, I'm an even bigger fan now.  Congrats to both Jeff and OpenTable! I really enjoyed Mashery CEO, Oren Michels, blog post on Sixth Sense Companies describing companies that "are already dead, but they just don't know it yet."  I thought it was dead on.   
 Over the last year, there’s been a tremendous amount of focus on the “Widget economy”.  Newsweek has even dubbed 2007 as the “Year of the Widget.”    While the concept of a “widget” might seem trivial to many outside of Silicon Valley, the ability to automatically embed a rich flash application inside another site is very powerful.  It has become a new vehicle for massively gaining viral distribution.  One well-known example is Youtube, as their growth was significantly driven by Myspace  -- with Myspace quickly becoming Youtube’s largest source of traffic.    And this new opportunity has not gone unnoticed by the VC community.  I'd estimate that over $250 million dollars has been invested in widget companies during the last 18 months.  And just as every consumer-facing Internet company has developed a strategy to leverage Google (via organic or paid search), they have also developed strategies to “widgitize” a portion of their application for distribution via Myspace.  While there are other sites which allow widget embedding, the vast majority of the growth has been on Myspace.  In fact, I would argue that until last week, the term “widget” has been synonymous with “embedded Myspace application.”     However, every widget company has been afraid of the uncertain rules of the road for operating on Myspace.  Myspace does not have a formal developers program and has blocked several widgets before, built their own widgets to compete in certain areas,  making it pretty clear that they don’t view the relationship with the widget ecosystem as symbiotic.   Myspace also has a policy against commercial activity in widgets, including placing advertising in a widget – leading some to wonder whether Myspace would ultimately erect a “tollbooth” for the widget providers.  This uncertain playing field provides a high degree of risk for the widget companies and their investors.  In fact, I’d think it safe to say that the #1 priority of virtually every widget company has been to “diversify our traffic away from Myspace.”  Rather than recognizing the symbiotic nature of their relationship with widget companies (as David Hornik wrote about a few weeks ago), Myspace’s lack of a clear “widget roadmap” created a big opportunity for their #1 competitor, Facebook.  Just last week, Facebook took advantage of that opportunity in  a huge way.  Specifically, Facebook announced their new development platform, F8.  I won’t spend a lot of time describing their announcement (I'll leave that to others), but I agree with Paul Allen’s summary of the three key points:  Applications can be deeply integrated with Facebook Distribution of the applications will occur through the network, and The business opportunity Facebook is providing will give 100% of advertising revenue (for third party applications) and 100% of transaction revenue to the application developers. By providing a clear roadmap – and business opportunity – for the widget makers, Facebook has just increased its virtual R&D budget by over $250 million dollars.  By welcoming third-party innovation, Facebook will reap the benefit of hundreds of millions of dollars of venture investment – and the Facebook user will have a much richer experience.  I'd wager that every widget maker who has previously relied on Myspace for traffic is hard at work this holiday weekend on migrating their application to support the Facebook API.    Think about it.  If you ran a venture-backed company and had to decide whether you wanted to focus your effort on:  (a) a property that welcomed you in and let you keep 100% of the revenue you generate or (b) a company with a vague policy that doesn’t let you generate any revenue, which would you choose?  I don’t think it’s even a decision.  It’s an IQ test.   Facebook has recognized (and embraced) something that Myspace has not – that there is more value in owning a web platform then a web property.  This brings back memories from the early days of the Internet, when companies like Prodigy and AOL were the only online services in town.   Despite the launch of the web browser (which unleashed the creation of millions of web sites), AOL and Prodigy initially focused on maintaining their proprietary online environment and controlling everything on their site.  It took a few years, but ultimately they saw that it is impossible for one company -- no matter how popular and well-funded -- to compete with an unlimited army of motivated (and funded) developers.  Even Microsoft recognizes that the true strength of it's Windows platform comes from the volume of third-party developers building (and profiting from selling) Windows applications.       Will Myspace remain a semi-closed web-property?  Or will it recognize that the power is in the platform?  It wouldn't be hard for Myspace to retake the offensive by offering a clear developers program.  All it requires is a realization that everyone benefits from third party investment of capital and creativity in the Myspace platform.  The users get far better functionality than Myspace can develop on its own.  Myspace would continue to receive hundreds of millions in "free product development".  And the widget companies could finally feel secure in their decision to invest in Myspace.  It will be interesting to see how this plays out… 
 So this post fits more under the "Redeye" category than "VC" category.  However, I recently came across two web-based travel services that I wanted to share.  Both of these services do a great job at removing friction from the travel marketplace...  The first is a company called BoardFirst.com.  They do one simple thing and do it well.  Namely, they guarantee you an "A group" boarding pass for Southwest Airlines.  If you've ever flown Southwest, you know that they don't have assigned seats.  Instead, they board passengers by groups based on when they printed their boarding pass.  This result has been that most sophisticated travellers now wait at their computer exactly 24 hours before their flight to beat the crowd for an "A group" boarding pass.  With BoardFirst, you simply give them your flight information, and they will take care of this for you for a small charge.  The difference between an aisle seat on an emergency exit row and a middle seat in the back of the plane is well worth the $5 charge.  The other service just launched from beta today and is from Yapta.com.   As someone who books travel months in advance, its as if this service was made for me!   I never realized it, but most major airlines will give you a refund if they reduce the price after you have bought a ticket.  So if the price on your ticket drops by $372, you are entitled to a voucher for $372 for a future trip.  So Yapta helps you by tracking fares (both before and) after you buy a ticket.  For example, I'm writing this post from a hotel room in Vegas on my way to San Diego for the WSJ D Conference.  And by using Yapta, I was able to learn that the fare for my ticket changed 19 times during a 13 day period.  And because they lowered the price after I booked my ticket, I was entitled to receive a voucher from US Airways for $197.60-- effectively reducing my fare by 30%.  It will be interesting to see how the airlines respond.  At first I thought the airlines would hate this, but then I realized that if it (a) gave people the confidence to book a seat early, and (b) increased repeat purchases through the use of vouchers, it could be a net positive for the airline industry.  There is some good coverage of Yapta in today's Wall Street Journal and Techcrunch.       I love how the web is removing friction and increasing our productivity in the travel space.  
 Congratulations to Brett and the entire Bazaarvoice team for reaching profitability this month! Because we invest at such an early stage, it’s always extremely rewarding to see one of our portfolio companies reach that milestone, and in only 14 months no less. I’ve always said that one of the most important characteristics I looks for in an entrepreneur is their ability to execute. Well, Brett, Sam and the entire team over at Bazaarvoice have been veritable execution machines over the past few months – setting goals, developing good execution plans, and achieving (more often surpassing) their desired results. Here are just a few examples of what they’ve been able to accomplish to date:  More than 90 paying customers, representing such leaders of e-commerce as Dell, HP, Macy’s, Overstock.com, PETCO, QVC, Sears, and The Home Depot. Serve 80% of the Internet Retailer Top 100 who outsource ratings and reviews. Serving over 250 million reviews per month. One of the favorite parts of my job is the ability to work with entrepreneurs such as those on Bazaarvoice’s team. I’m excited to watch their continued progress over the next 14 months. 
 I've recently begun watching the first two seasons of Lost on DVD -- and have found some striking similarities between the TV show and launching an Internet site.  The TV show tells the story of the survivors of Oceanic flight 815 -- and the bizarre island they land on.  Gradually, over a period of weeks, the survivors learn about their environment and discover some of the secrets of the island and the mysterious Dharma initiative.  This knowledge is not gathered easily -- their trial-and-error results in a lot of false conclusions and costly mistakes.  Most post-launch startups are also lost.  They don't fully understand the environment they are operating in -- or how to improve/impact it.  Things don't behave as the founders initially expected or logic might dictate.  With all of the data exhaust a website can generate, it's very hard to differentiate the signal from the noise (ie, determine which metrics matter and which don't).  Big functionality deployments can have no real impact on the numbers, yet sometimes small actions like pressing (or not pressing) a button at a specified time, have a major effect.    Munjal Shah, the CEO of Like.com (Riya), has resumed blogging about his startup's journey.  And his current episode (Number 23) does a wonderful job of describing the lack of knowledge a company initially has about their site -- and the process they must go through to gain understanding.  It brings back many vivid memories from my days at Half.com.  Trying to isolate cause and effect in an online environment is not as easy as it might sound.  It takes a lot of effort, testing and time to begin to understand the levers at your disposal -- and the impact each lever has on your key metrics.  Munjal and team have begun to build a core culture and competency around A/B testing (otherwise known as multivariate testing).    I'm impressed to see them get A/B religion so early in their development - it takes many companies much longer to adopt this approach.  I think that this type of disciplined, statistical approach towards site improvement is a critical component in metric improvement.  Munjal's post is definitely worth the read... 
 As the success of sites such as MySpace, Facebook, LinkedIn, Classmates, and Geni have demonstrated, viral marketing can be a very effective tool to help build social networks that appeal to a wide range of people for a number of different reasons.   Beyond the specific markets that they focus on, these sites have fundamental differences in how they acquire new users, generate revenue, and grow their business.   But what all of the most successful social networks have in common is that they’ve perfected what I like to call a "catch and keep" model. From the first time a user signs up for a MySpace, or a Facebook, they find themselves sucked into spending hours on the site, and feel compelled to both return on a regular basis, and drag their friends into their network. As recent data demonstrates, the top social networks are among the highest trafficked and stickiest sites on the web.  In sharp contrast, most social networks out there have what I call a "catch and release" model. They can generate buzz, get written up in the blogosphere, and even get 53,651 beta testers, but few of those initial users ever return to the site. There can be many reasons for this. The site may appeal to a group of people that just don’t need to communicate on a daily basis, for example old classmates, or distant relatives. They may have a cool feature set that presents data in some unique or surprising way, but is not enough to compel someone to come back on a daily basis.   [Note - this phenomenon doesn't only apply to social networks -- I've visited Zillow once, but have not found a reason to return...]   The catch and release model often occurs because it’s much easier to get someone to your site with the promise of value -- and much, much tougher to offer those users a compelling reason to return and invite their friends.   A good example of a catch and release business model is Classmates.com.  When it was acquired in 2004, Classmates had a reported 38 million registered users (1.4 million of which were paid). Despite adding 1.5 million new registered users per month, by 2006 the total registered user count had only gone up to 40 million members. Given the amount of money Classmates spends on online advertising ($12.6 million in February 2007 alone) that’s some churn rate!   Classmates User Acquisition Model      The effects of the catch and release business model show up in a company’s valuation. Classmates was acquired for $100 million by United Online in 2004. At the time the site had 38 million registered users, and was generating $72 million in annual revenue. This gives it a 1.4x revenue multiple, and a value of $2.63 per user.   Contrast that with one of the leading catch and keep social networks, Facebook.  By limiting its initial scope to a select group of universities, Facebook ensured that its first few members were likely to know a lot of other people on the site, and have a lot in common with them (through both shared friends and interests.) Facebook successfully leveraged the connections that were being developed through that initial community to virally expand into other schools, growing rapidly until it had captured 85% of the college market only a year after launching.   Since then Facebook has opened up its network to anyone. The numbers behind their success speak for themselves: 6th most trafficked site in the US, 16 million unique monthly visitors, and 30 billion monthly impressions, all without a penny spent on advertising. Perhaps most impressive is how loyal those users are – 60% access their Facebook accounts every day, and 90% every month. The average user visits the site 24 times a month.   Facebook User Acquisition Model    Their catch and keep model is reflected in their valuation.  In 2006 it was confirmed that the company had received a $1 billion acquisition offer from Yahoo. At the time, Facebook had a reported 14 million registered users, and was generating an estimated $50 million in annual revenue. This gives it a 20x revenue multiple, and a value of $71.43 per user.   Which type of social network would you rather be?  It's clear that if you’re building a social network or are planning on starting one, it’s important to know whether you have a catch & release business model, or a catch & keep business model. I’m looking forward to seeing how the different social networks will evolve over time. 
 Is there really something for nothing?  Almost all free services (whether it be network television, online search, or free directory assistance) offer something for free to consumers because it is being subsidized by third-party advertisers.  That’s nothing new or surprising.   As an investor in Jingle Network’s 1-800-FREE411 service, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about Google’s free directory assistance offering – and wondering why they are offering it without any advertising.  Why would they take on that cost (including the toll free call + call completion + SMS cost) for nothing?  Is it just to gain market share, or is there another reason?  It was only after I read Tim O’Reilly’s recent blog post, that the answer hit me: Just like the witch Ursula in the Little Mermaid, Google wants your voice.  Take this quote from Mike McCue (CEO of TellMe) from February of 2007 (just two months before Microsoft bought TellMe):  “…our search index is better than Google's right now. The grammars that we have -- we do about 10 billion speech utterances a year. So what we are able to do is make the speech recognition system smarter and smarter. And that is something that Google can't get until they get that similar kind of traffic. How are they going to get that traffic? It's a chicken-and-egg problem.”  So is Google collecting our utterances?  It appears they are – check out Google’s 411 Privacy Policy:  “We also collect and store a copy of the voice commands you make to the service, so we can audit, evaluate, and improve the voice recognition capabilities of the service.”  Assuming each call has four utterances – and costs 3 cents each on average – then it would cost Google about $8M for 1 billion utterances (or $80M to match TellMe’s 10 billion utterances).  A bargain compared to buying Tellme for $800M.  I agree with Tim O’Reilly’s conclusion that Google’s launch of a directory assistance product was accelerated (and is driven) by their desire to compete with Microsoft.  But one thing Tim didn’t discuss is the privacy implications of Google’s actions.  Google is recording and storing voice prints of all users - and it's not a stretch to imagine that they are matching them up to caller-id numbers to build out user profiles.  And this is very valuable data to have.  Collect enough voice signatures and you can tell if a caller is a male or a female – and possibly even detect where they are from by their accent.   And Google’s privacy policy lets them save your recordings for an undisclosed period of time.  Should Google own your voice?  What privacy issues does that raise?  All of the recent   controversy   about Google’s privacy policy doesn’t even contemplate them archiving your voice.  Given the high level of concern about Google’s retention of text search logs, I imagine it won't be long until privacy advocates focus on this as well.  [Insert shameless plug here -> If you don’t want your voice recordings saved, feel free to call 1-800-FREE411 -- they don’t store any voice recordings…]  I think it’s important for consumers to recognize what they are “paying” for a free service.  With 1-800-FREE411, you’re “paying” by listening to their advertisements.  With Google, you’re paying by giving them your voice.  At least Ursula clearly disclosed her bargain to Ariel. 
 Over the past year there have been several insightful posts on the similarities between Deal or No Deal and the venture business.  Lately I’ve found that there’s another popular show that good lessons can be drawn from – American Idol. (I admit it -- I watch American Idol.  Think what you want of me.)   As an entrepreneur, I watched the first few seasons of American Idol and found myself empathizing with the contestants; the person whose hopes and dreams were on the line.  Just like a technology startup, with so much competition the "beta" is very high.    Now that I'm a VC, I find myself identifying much more with the judges sitting on the other side of the table.  They filter through thousands of hopeful applicants to find a handful of the most promising candidates.  And for every candidate they accept, they pass on hundreds of others.  Kind of like my job.  Last quarter we reviewed over 600 deals -- that means that my partners and I were passing on an average of 10 deals a day.  I've found that this is one of the toughest parts of making the transition from being an entrepreneur to a VC.  I know how hard it is to be an entrepreneur -- and I'd love to be able to be helpful/supportive/encouraging to all of them.  And it sure is not fun to say no to people 50 times a week.  And unlike most VC's, as a seed-stage firm we can't use the most common excuse: "It's too early for us, come back to us after you've proven XXX."     So watching American Idol, I can’t help but wonder: which judge’s style would be most effective in the venture business?  Is it Simon’s brutal honesty and candor?  While he comes across as an unsympathetic ass, I have to admit that I usually agree with his assessment.  More often than not he’s right, and his feedback tends to elicit that ring of truth among viewers hearing something they know to be true but may never verbalize. On the other hand, although most contestants would be better off heeding his advice and not quitting their day jobs, his unvarnished assessments appear rude, leaving them upset and disillusioned.  Is it Paula’s unbridled enthusiasm and politeness? No matter how much a contestant sucks, Paula will always find something nice to say, even if it’s just about their outfit.  Although the candidate may come away feeling better, are they really getting the kind of advice to help them decide whether to dedicate a couple of years and potentially millions of dollars to their idea?  ("Your powerpoint looks hot" or "You made that demo your own" just don't seem to work)  Or is it Randy’s noncommittal, whats up dawg feedback? Often on the fence, Randy’s comments tend to be vague, lacking in any real substance. But his lack of an opinion can leave the contestant guessing as to what he really thought, which makes it difficult for both of them to make any real progress.   So which style is best for an investor? The answer is that I’m not quite sure yet.  My wife (frequently) describes me as "often wrong but never in doubt."  As such, my natural tendency with entrepreneurs has been to candidly share my thoughts and opinions.  However, when I'm looking at a plan that is a clear "Sanjaya", if I give an entrepreneur my straight-up opinion (like Simon) I often find that I've made an enemy for life.  When I give false encouragement like Paula, I'm misleading them as to my true level of interest.  And when I am non-committal like Randy, I drag the entrepreneur along.  My thoughts on this are definitely still a work in progress.  Fred Wilson has some good perspective on the subject.  What do you think?
